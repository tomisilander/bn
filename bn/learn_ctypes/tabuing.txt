Thinking about keeping a tabu-list to guide the search :

Setting: we have a network candidate S and a set of moves we have tried
before on S without improvement.

Now there is no point trying the same moves again. However, if we try
something else and it works producing S1, should we empty the whole
tabu set, since now the earlier moves might prove succesfull on S1.

Suppose we delete the arc A=(v1, v2). Now, scorewise, the situation
has changed only for v2 and earlier ineffective legal moves (adding an
arc to v2, deleting an arc to v2, reversing an arc having v2 in either
end) may now be succesful. Also some of the earlier illegal moves may
become legal, while eralier legal moves are still legal.

Suppose we add the arc A=(v1,v2).  Now, scorewise, the situation has
changed only for v2 and earlier ineffective legal moves (adding an arc
to v2, deleting an arc to v2, reversing an arc having v2 in either
end) may now be succesful, however, some of the earlier legal moves on
v2 may now have become illegal, while earlier illegal moves are still
illegal.

Suppose we reverse the arc A=(v1,v2).  Now, scorewise, the situation has
changed only for v1 and v2 and earlier ineffective legal moves (adding an arc
to v2, deleting an arc to v2, reversing an arc having v2 in either
end) may now be succesful, however, some of the earlier legal moves on
v1 and v2 may now have become illegal and some illegal ones may now be legal.

The analysis above suggests that only some tabu items are
discarded. More specifically, after succesfull addition or deletion of
a = (v1,v2), the additions and deletions of form (v,v2) are not tabu
any more.  Also reversals of (v,v2) and (v2,v) might be useful now,
since the first one implies the deletion of arc to v2 and the second
one an addition of arc to v2.


After succesfull arc reversal of (v1,v2) to (v2,v1)
the additions and deletions of form (v,v2) and (v,v1) are not tabu
any more.  Also reversals containing nodes v1 and v2 might be useful now.
