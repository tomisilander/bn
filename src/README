This is the part of the bigger project, totally in the inconlusive state.
However, stuff in the infer directory is in a reasonable shape even
if a lot of cleaning should be done there. Please read infer/README
for more information about inferer.

In this directory, you might want to use str2bn.py to get b-course
stye structure files to bn-files. bn-file format is very simple: the
first line contains the number of variables and the folloing lines
contain two numbers denoting the from and to indices of an arc.

You may also use bn_picture.py to turn bn-files to gifs, but you have
to have graphviz-package installed for that to work.

This also requires libJudy at least to compile the c-files.
