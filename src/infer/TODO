More documentation,
- README is outdated
- Wonder if bucketelimination underflows if lots of evidence
  - belim not important though, there for just testing
- gibbsampler nees a ginferer.py frontend

There is lots of repetition that could be avoided by better design.
Look for example inferer and bucketinferer
